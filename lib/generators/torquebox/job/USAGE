Description:
    Scheduled jobs are simply components that execute on a possibly-recurring schedule instead of in response to user interaction.
    Scheduled jobs fire asynchronously, outside of the normal web-browser thread-of-control.
    Scheduled jobs have full access to the entire Ruby environment.
    This allows them to interact with database models and other application functionality.

    This generator creates a Ruby class that implements a run() method.

Example:
    rails g torque_box:job MyJob

    This will create:
        app/jobs/my_job.rb
